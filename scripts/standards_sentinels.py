"""Zero-like sentinels: what counts as one, and when the code has already excused it.

Split out of standards_checks.py when that file crossed the pack's own 500-line limit --
the pack does not get to baseline itself. The seam is a real responsibility boundary, not
a line-count trick: this file answers "is a zero-like fallback a lie here?", while
standards_checks.py answers "what does each language look like?".

Two rules live here, and the difference between them is the whole point:

    unset-not-zero   the NAME can never legitimately be zero-like (an identity, an
                     external reference), so a zero-like fallback destroys information.
    payload-default  the VALUE can legitimately be zero, but it was read from an external
                     payload by literal key, so a default invents data that never arrived.

Only the first gets the guard exemption below, and the asymmetry is deliberate -- see
_guards_against_sentinel.
